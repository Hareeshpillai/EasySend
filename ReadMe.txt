Project title: EasySend (https://shinayang.github.io/)
- 

Description:
    By big data of post office, we input senders' and receivers' contact information in the APP. 
    Through the APP processing, we can obtain a barcode in exchange for all the information we input. 
    After the server scans the barcode, the contact information can be printed out and pasted on the envelope. 
    Hence we can save time and reduce typo simultaneously. 
    Also, sender will receive the email notification after the package arrive the receiver.
    Our APP's functionality:
        1. Avoid format and handwriting problem
	2. Save sender’s time from writing same information
	3. Address directly use from google map
	4. Convenient for both servers and customers by using barcode
	5. Automatically notify the situation of package to sender
	6. Easy to find Post office

Instructor: Dr. Hareesh, National Tsing Hua University. 

The project is organized in the following folders:
    1. Ideation
	We want to build an APP for senders. 
	The APP has fixed format to fill in, which allows people easily complete by themselves, and thus saving both sender's and receiver's time.  
    2. UML design
	We drew use case diagram and sequence diagram in homework 3. 
	The UML design let us understand more about the relationships between every process.
    3. Final project presentation
	At first, we wanted to choose android studio to build an APP for our final presentation.
	Dr.Hareesh suggested us try the programming we newly learned, so we use HTML, which all of us have learned in this semester for the first time.
	We are glad we did and have learned a new programming skill.
    4. Demonstration video
	The Demo video shows how we operate the Webpage.
    5. Coding in Sublime Text
	We use HTML in our project to build the user interface, and use css to control the format. 
	For the index, we want to express an imagination of envelope and use some resource download from Post office website.
	The service page, we use google map with search function. People can easily find post office that near them.
	Our major contribute is the Package and the Order information. 
	Function of Package is helping people choose the history or favorite contact or using google map. Barcode will print after they complete filling information.
	Order information is the concise text of the previous order. People can show the barcode from here to server.
    6. Bugs and future improvements
	Our interface is ready for demonstrate but not able to transmit data to each other yet.
	We hope the Web page can integrate with the APP that people can conveniently use in their phone.
